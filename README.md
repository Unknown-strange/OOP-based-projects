# 🐍 Learning OOP with Python – ChatGPT Problem Sets

## Overview

This repository contains my Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) practice. I am using **ChatGPT as a learning guide**, where I receive problem sets on OOP concepts, implement solutions, and refine them through feedback.

The purpose of this project is to **build strong OOP fundamentals** in Python by:

* Understanding classes, objects, and constructors
* Practicing encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
* Applying real-world problem-solving
* Iteratively improving solutions through guided learning

---

## 📚 Problem Sets & Projects

Each folder or Python file represents a **problem set or project**. The challenges start from **Level 1 (foundations)** and progress to more advanced OOP topics.

### Example Projects:

1. **Level 1 – Student Management System**

   * Create `Student` class with attributes like name, student ID, course
   * Implement methods: `add_score()`, `calculate_average()`, `display_profile()`
   * Practice object creation and state management

2. **Level 2 – Bank Account System**

   * Learn encapsulation
   * Validate deposits and withdrawals
     *(to be added as I progress)*

3. **Level 3+ – Advanced OOP Concepts**

   * Inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes, and design patterns
     *(upcoming problem sets as I continue learning)*

---

## 🚀 How I Solve Each Problem

1. Receive a **problem set from ChatGPT**
2. Implement the solution in Python
3. Test the solution with multiple examples
4. Iterate based on feedback
5. Commit the working solution to this repository

## 🛠 Skills Learned

* Python classes and objects
* `__init__` constructor usage
* Instance vs class attributes
* Encapsulation and validation
* Method design and object behavior
* Polymorphism and inheritance basics
* Problem-solving mindset in OOP

## 📖 Notes

* All solutions are written **from scratch** with guidance from ChatGPT
* Solutions are **iteratively improved** based on debugging and feedback
* Future updates will include **more advanced problem sets** and **refactoring exercises**

---

## ⚡ Goal

By the end of this project, I aim to:

* Gain **industry-ready OOP intuition**
* Solve **real-world problems using classes and objects**
* Build a **portfolio of Python OOP projects**

---

## 📫 Contact / Feedback

* Open to suggestions or feedback on improving OOP code structure
* Feel free to **fork or star** the repo if you’re learning OOP too!

---

I can also create a **version with badges, Python version, and GitHub stats** to make it look professional if you want to use it as your main portfolio repo.

Do you want me to do that next?
